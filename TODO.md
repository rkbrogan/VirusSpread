# notes

## 10/7

- reviewed 5 (?) job postings and decided/determined:
  - there is **no** reason not to apply for all and *see what happens*
    - most, if not all, had enough of an overlap that it was worth going through the process
    - for *showstopper* items (*e.g.*, location), reach out and query as to whether it really is a showstopper
  - multi-threaded (concurrent) programming is a consistent requirement
    - continuing to work w/`pthreads` seems like a good path
    - eventually, may want to convert code to use the `C` and/or `C++` threading models, as documented on [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)
- WRT another **requirement** - *lower level* programming - we did a quick overview of the [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) project, structure and excellent supporting materials
  - > *review and consider for future project*

### 10/7 next

- update artifacts (*e.g.*, resume, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riley-brogan-6a56a8117/), *etc.*) in preparation to apply for jobs
  - apply for at least 3/5 jobs discussed today?
- continue understanding of threads via UTs
- work on the *counter* application - structured as a stand-alone app or UT(s)

good luck and have fun!

## 9/9 & 9/29

  > these notes include both meeting dates, as I forgot to enter the 9/9 notes in a timely manner - mea culpa‚ùó

- discussed home ownership and the need to become an *expert* in things that you never considered; plumbing, insulation, multiple-service accounts, *etc.*
  > fun, fun, fun...üòé
- work update...boring...stagnating...you didn't have a lot to say that was good...
- job search...not started...understandably...
  - time to start job prep‚Ä¶put in place before baby
  - leverage interests and knowledge (*e.g.*, qt, embedded) to help search for possible jobs
  - what are the common interests/requirements/*etc.*?
    - *e.g.*, business logic, gaming, qt/ui, drivers‚Ä¶

### 9/29 next

- find at least 3 job postings that we can review/discuss
- continue work w/MT

Good luck and have fun!

## 8/18

- After a few meetings discussing home shopping/buying/ownership, and parenthood, today we started w/a bit of scatological talk WRT both cats üêà & babies üë∂
- Reviewed (decipheredüòé?) MT UTs, including why relying on timing is a **very bad thing**, and how the (input) values for `nthreads`, `target_total` and `use_lock` impact results, and performance...
  > Consider how you might time (using munit's built-in timing capabilities?) the impacts of these variables - for reference/inspiration:
  1. [time(1) - Linux man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/time)
  2. [Date and time utilities - cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/chrono)
  3. [portable-snippets/clock ¬∑ nemequ/portable-snippets](https://github.com/nemequ/portable-snippets/tree/master/clock)
      > This is the timing code used by `munit`

### 8/18 next

- Complete UTs that demonstrate different *counter* behavior when varying the values of input values (see above)
- Additionally, besides behavior, consider their impact on *performance*?

Good luck and have fun!

## 7/23

- Continued MT UT development
- First UT uses global variables for `grand_total`, `gt_lock`, and settings such as the `bool` `use_lock`
- Next UT relied on a passed in argument *struct* vs. *global vars*
  - But still used the na√Øve algorithm of updating a shared `grand_total` for each iteration through the loop ‚Äì tons of contentions

### 7/23 next

- Cleanup ‚Äì document, refactor for shared code/data, *etc.* ‚Äì the first two MT UTs mentioned above
- Write pending UT that uses a local `sub_total` - smarter algorithm
- Determine how to vary inputs: `thread_count`, `sum`, `use_lock`‚Ä¶

Good luck and have fun!

## 7/7

- Today we started w/Elena‚Äôs harrowing (‚ùó) story
- Discussed whether to use a MT `main()` vs. UTs and opted for the latter
- Wrote a simple UT to create/join a thread and discussed how passing arguments is tricky:
  - Typical pattern is to `malloc()` a `struct` that contains the threads‚Äô arguments

### 7/7 next

- Complete UTs to implement/test counter:
  - Different count algorithms
  - Different command line arguments
  - Different partitioning:
    - Work
    - Data

- Good luck and have fun!

## 6/30

- Discussed how work does **not** value its employees ‚Äì unless you‚Äôre a member of the *right* group
- Discussed how you should *jump* before, eventually, getting *pushed*
- Discussed ‚Äì ‚Äú*What makes you different?*‚Äù
  - Embedded
  - `QT`
  - *What else?*

### 6/30 next

- Scope out potential jobs, and determine what tech skills need refining
  - *What's needed?*
- Complete MT UTs
- Implement a MT count program that takes three command line arguments:
  - Total (*e.g.*, `100000`)
  - Number of threads (max. 8, *e.g.*, `4`)
  - Lock (bool, *e.g.*, `-l`)  
  
  The program should create the requested number of threads and have each thread add to total, w/ or w/o locking  
  
  The results should print:
  - Grand total (`sum * n_threads`, *e.g.*, 400000)
  - Elapsed time (`m:ss.ms`)

Good luck and have fun!

## 6/11

- Caught up on life, work, sleep‚Ä¶
- Looked over virus state‚Ä¶at least one issue was due to using `atoi()` vs.`atof()`
- Determined that virus functionality is done but code requires scrubbing
  ‚Äì structure, naming, style, dead code, commented out code, *etc.*
  > Ensure that all remnants to simulate and analyze are eliminated
- *What would you like to do WRT visualize?*

### 6/11 next

- Complete virus
  - Determine where/how to add MT
- Write a practice MT program w/ command line:  
  > `./count n-threads sum lock`
- Where each thread increments a counter until it reaches `sum`. The `sum` of each thread should then be added to a *grand total*. The lock boolean determines whether locking (mutexes) are employed. The program should display the grand total (`n-threads * sum`) based on the CLAs.
- Include a timer capability to help measure differences.
- Defaults: n-threads=1, sum=100,000, lock=false.

Good luck and have fun!

## 5/13

- worked on some details of using `getopt()` - *normalizing* command line args and processing
- discussed need to:
  - eliminate remnants of  `simulate`/`analyze` and make `nrtials` the differentiator
    > may need to special case some calculations when `ntrials == 1`, in order to avoid *divide-by-zero*
  - normalize (old) `simulate`/`analyze` *output*
- committed 5/5 notesüòé (wrote 'em last week...never committed 'em...)

### 5/13 next

- define, and drive this implementation of `virus`, to completion: functionality, UI, testing, internal state...
- consider `v.next`, a `MT` (multi-threaded) implementation of `virus` based on [POSIX Threads Programming | LLNL HPC Tutorials](https://hpc-tutorials.llnl.gov/posix/)
  > I believe that *trials* is the natural *axis* to apply *threading*, but there may be others, *e.g.*, *person*, *etc.* ‚ùì

## 5/5

- busy week so no progress‚Ä¶*c'est la vie*‚Ä¶
- chatted about technical challenge at work ‚Äì I suggested a *wrapping* approach:
  > wrap old function w/new or new w/old
- wrt `virus` we discussed [getopt/getopt_long](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getopt.3.html) and its applicability to the objective of surfacing all constants (and variable/parameter values) to the command line

### 5/5 next

- complete implementation of command line parsing using `getop()`/`getoptlong()`
- See previous

> good luck and have fun!

## 4/28

- sounds like life‚Äôs been good...bro' visit...üéÇüé≥ w/friends...and even work's been challenging/interesting given your foray into the work of wi-fi networks
- discussed the *ethics of analytics*üòé
- once you attempted to share your screen, we ran into a wierd bluriness problem, resolved by switching to Zoom for now...
- a quick review of your implementation (which looked good), and some discussion led to a few recommendations:
  - fully combine `simulate` and `analyze` vs. delineate by `ntrials`
  - normalize console and data (files) formats
  - surface all constants via the command line
  - use `getopt` to parse and UT the command line arguments/options

### 4/28 next

- complete integration such that `ntrials` is just another argument
- complete command line
- complete UTs and implementation of core functions
- consider what's next, *e.g.,* new project or `otp v.next`:
  - concurrrency (threads)
  - client/server
  - I/O GUI:
    - input: window based UI w/widgets, *etc.*
    - output: various plots, dashboards, *etc.*

## 4/12

- unfortunately, more time spent on *configuration* issues:
  - VS Code's *internal* build/debugger:
    - `tasks.json`
    - `launch.json`
    - *etc.*
  - external `Makefile`

### 4/12 next

- [ ] **complete** build/debug workflow for both the `virus` and `virus-test` executables, *or*, return to a single executable w/`test` as a fourth sub-command
- ignoring *visualization*, the PDF describes *features*, that you should combine into a single executable:
  1) command line parsing
  2) mathematical-style `f()`-s - take some input and transform it to some output - no side-effects (*i.e.*, easier to UT)
  3) output - anything from simulation summaries to `CSV` files for post-procerssoing, or...

- [ ] **complete** (i.) using: [getopt(3) - Linux manual page](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getopt.3.html)

## 4/4

- once again we focused mostly on build/debug config issues:
  - `Makefile`, `task.json`, `launch.json`
  - tools, *e.g.*, `clang` vs. `gcc`...
  - debugger & extensions: `gdb`, `lldb`

### 4/4 next

- double check tools, extensions, *etc.*
- any access to a *clean* Mac? Maybe a virtual one in the cloud:
  - *clean* environment
- **post-lesson** - working on `hello world` repo/app...get it working again on `virus`‚ùó
- how can I help get past this roadblock?

## 3/27

- unfortunately, not a lot of progress this week
- spent most of Lesson working on debugger configuration:
  - `launch.json`
  - appropriate debugger extension
- use the PDF as a set of *guidelines* or a *specification*, rather then an *assignment*:
  - one executable for *all* functionality
    - `simulate`
    - `analyze`
    - `visualize`
  - the latter can be done w/an external utility (ala the PDF), a plotting library or both - your call...be creative...w/o over-engineeringüòé

### 3/27 next

- get debugger config working
- structure code, `Makefile`, *etc.* to support one application executable

## 3/19

- discussed the üë∞ü§µ and the timing of the universe - flat üõû
- you didn't have a chance to review the PDF and so our focus was on the annoying üòé `Makefile‚Äã`
- after some fiddling - to resolve the multiple `main.c‚Äã` issue - w/macros/file filtering in the `Makefile‚Äã`, followed by some file renaming and...
    > **both the test and main‚Äã executable could both be built‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó**
- finally, we agreed to experiment w/this - `TODO.md‚Äã` - for notes, plans, references, *etc.* in lieu of ClickUp

### 3/19 next

- review PDF and put together a go-forward plan of attacküòé
- clean up code/repo (as needed) in prep for the *go-forward plan of attack*
